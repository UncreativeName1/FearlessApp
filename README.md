# Fearless
Public Speaking App for @unitedspeakersglobal

In collaboration with United Speakers Global, Fearless is an app for a public speaking community who hopes to master their confidence on stage or in front of a camera. The Fearless App will be dedicated to helping others improve their public speaking skills.

Through the app, you will be able to learn various aspects of public speaking with handmade lessons from United Speakers Global to improve your strength and confidence in speaking for an audience. Users can also practice their speaking by recording a speech and listening and analyzing to it after. Fearless reports on filler words after the recording. You can customize which filler words you want to be detected for a personalized experience.

Learn, practice, and improve your public speaking with Fearless.
